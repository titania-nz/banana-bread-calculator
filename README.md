# Banana Bread Calculator

This repository contains a simple React + TypeScript application that calculates ingredient amounts for banana bread. Adjust the number of bananas (between 1 and 100) and the app displays the scaled recipe in either metric or US measurements.

## Running locally

The project does not ship with a build system. Copy `App.tsx`, the `components` directory and `styles/globals.css` into a React setup of your choice (for example using Vite) and install the usual dependencies. Then start your development server as normal.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
